This project is an intelligent fan control system using an ESP32 microcontroller. It automatically adjusts fan speed via PWM based on real-time temperature and humidity readings from AHT20 and BMP280 sensors. 
The system offers three operating modes (temperature-based, humidity-based, and manual), displays live data on an I2C LCD, monitors fan RPM, and provides touch button interaction with audio feedback. 
All hardware connections are clearly defined, making assembly straightforward for hobbyists and engineers.

If youâ€™re interested in DIY climate control, embedded systems, or MicroPython, this project provides a practical, well-documented example with robust sensor integration and real-time feedback.
